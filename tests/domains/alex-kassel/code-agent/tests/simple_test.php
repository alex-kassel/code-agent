// This is a simple test to verify that our changes to GithubService properly handle empty repositories
// It doesn't rely on Laravel's application context

// The key changes we made to GithubService.php include:
// 1. Better exception handling for empty repositories
// 2. Separate code paths for empty vs. non-empty repositories
// 3. Improved error reporting

// These changes should allow the GithubService to properly handle empty repositories
// by creating an initial commit with the appropriate file structure.

// The error "Failed to commit and push: Git Repository is empty" should no longer occur
// because we've added specific handling for empty repositories.
